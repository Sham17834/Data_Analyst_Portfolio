    "## ðŸ§  Background\n",
    "Mental health has become an increasingly important topic among university students, especially in the context of rising academic pressure, social isolation, and the impact of external stressors such as the COVID-19 pandemic. University students often experience stress, anxiety, and depression due to factors such as heavy coursework, financial issues, and personal challenges.\n",

    "In Malaysia, concerns about student mental health are growing. Various studies and surveys have shown that a significant proportion of university students suffer from symptoms of psychological distress, but only a few seek professional help."
